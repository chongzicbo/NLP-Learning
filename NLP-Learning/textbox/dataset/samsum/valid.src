"Luigi: Geez, Mayweather totally destroyed McGregor! Did you watch gentlemen?? [SEP] Lorenzo: I'm not very much into boxing, rather prefer MMA but the buzz about this fight made me watch it [SEP] Lorenzo: And yeah, the black guy seemed to be only defending himself for a few rounds but at the same time Conor lost much of his stamina [SEP] Pablo: Whatta hell are you two talking about?? [SEP] Pablo: McGregor and boxing?? He's an mma warrior, those R 2 different worlds! Wtf [SEP] Pablo: And Mayweather?? He's fuckin 40, he's to fuckin old to fight!

[SEP] Pablo: He's fuckin one unpredictable piece of bastard [SEP] Lorenzo: You better watch your mouth Pablo cause if Conor finds out what you're sayin, you'll be the next xD [SEP] Pablo: Sheit dudes, that's a fuckin nonsense [SEP] Pablo: But anyway... Mayweather won, you've said that. And McGregor? Was he sharp? [SEP] Luigi: He was, actually I was surprised cause he was fighting pretty well for 5 maybe 6 rounds [SEP] Luigi: Floyd had to keep his guard up and seemed to have little chances cuz the Irishman was attacking again an again [SEP] Luigi: But you know, Floyd is an old bird and all this time he was waiting for Conor to get tired and you know the rest :) [SEP] Pablo: Experience bitch, he beat 'The Notorious' thanks to his fuckin experience! [SEP] Luigi: No doubt about it, bro [SEP] Lorenzo: But you know, Mcgregor's never fought 10 rounds, in MMA 3 rounds is the limit [SEP] Pablo: True [SEP] Lorenzo: So what if they agreed for a rematch on the mma rules?? :) [SEP] Pablo: Duuuuuude [SEP] Pablo: Conor would destroy him, no doubt [SEP] Luigi: Who knows, maybe they've been planning two differnt fights, who knows :) [SEP] Pablo: Hope so, I'm goin to fuckin wait for the fight even if it would be at 4 am [SEP] Lorenzo: Good old Pablo... I love your temperament you son of a bitch [SEP] Pablo: Yeah, you're not the first bitch to say that [SEP] Luigi: Lol xD"
"Emily: Hi, so what do u think about the change of ENG teachers? [SEP] Sophie: Hi, well I must admit that I was quite surprised. [SEP] Sophie: I don't really understand why we weren't informed b4 March break. [SEP] Emily: I think they didn't want us 2 panic during our holidays. [SEP] Emily: The school was closed 4 2wks so no one would be available to deal with our Qs & concerns. [SEP] Sophie: You might be right. [SEP] Emily: And I'm sure the new teacher is highly qualified. [SEP] Sophie: Yeah, she has an MA in education & she's a native Canadian speaker. [SEP] Emily: Oh, I didn't know that.

'Kyle: Who wants to go out for a drink? [SEP] Megan: No, sorry, I\'m cleaning the house today. [SEP] Roseanne: You\'ve always loved cleaning, haven\'t you? I remember how angry you used to get with your brother for leaving a mess in the kitchen. [SEP] Vince: Yeah, she\'d always yell at me, even though I was the one in charge when our parents were away. [SEP] Kyle: I don\'t get why it matters so much whether I clean my flat once a week or once a month. No one died from a bit of dust. [SEP] Megan: Remind me to never stay at your place :P [SEP] Roseanne: I\'m somewhere in between. My house is always a mess, but I hate it when it\'s dirty. [SEP] Vince: What\'s the difference? [SEP] Roseanne: I can\'t stand when there\'s dust, crumbs on the floor etc., so I clean regularly. But I love it when all my stuff just lies around. When I put everything back on shelves or into cabinets, I keep on getting mad that I have to look for it, get up and take it out, and generally lose so much time. I like to have everything within my reach. [SEP] Vince: There\'s no better wardrobe than the armchair, right? XD [SEP] Kyle: I prefer the floor. There\'s more space on it :D [SEP] Megan: Just reading this gives me the creeps. [SEP] Kyle: Fine, go back to cleaning, we\'ll think of you while sharing a beer :D [SEP] Roseanne: Hey, I never said I can come. My hubby\'s away this weekend, so I have no one to leave the kids with ;( [SEP] Vince: Take them to Megan\'s place, they can help her clean :D [SEP] Megan: You know what? I don\'t care. I can watch your kids, Roseanne. Just bring them over. [SEP] Roseanne: But are you serious or just mad at us? [SEP] Megan: No, I\'m serious. I like your kids. And they\'re nice enough that if I ask them to do something, they actually do it :D [SEP] Roseanne: LOL, okay. Actually, I think that when I tell them to go and help aunt Meg with cleaning, they\'ll think it\'s fun. [SEP] Vince: And when you tell them to clean their own rooms, they say you\'re a monster? :D [SEP] Roseanne: Exactly. But Bill for example always cleans the windows at my parents house. They don\'t even need to ask anymore, he simply knows it\'s his job. [SEP] Kyle: Do they pay him? :P [SEP] Roseanne: Well, sometimes. But still I think he likes doing it. I don\'t know, maybe it\'s because no one checks if he did it well, he\'s just left alone to do his thing, so he feels like a man in the house in a way? [SEP] Megan: Tell them I can pay with cookies if they help me. [SEP] Roseanne: The famous chocolate cookies? [SEP] Megan: Why not? I\'m feeling generous today :D [SEP] Roseanne: Guys, I think I\'m gonna change my mind about that beer. Meg, would you accept one more helper? :D [SEP] Megan: You\'re always welcome! But sorry boys, it\'s going to be a "girls only" event (except for little Billy). Otherwise my house will never get cleaned today :D'

Are you serious? [SEP] Sandra: What do you think? [SEP] Olivia: Hm, not sure. It sounds really cool, but isn't it dangerous? [SEP] Sandra: Well, it can be, yes, but I don't think it's much more dangerous than driving a car. [SEP] Sandra: Accidents happen everywhere. I get your point, I was thinking about it as well. [SEP] Olivia: And? Aren't you afraid? [SEP] Sandra: A bit, yes, but I always wanted to learn horse riding, so I thought that as soon as it isn't anything that requires me to, I don't know, go abroad or a lot of money, I may at least give it a try. [SEP] Olivia: Makes sense. I'm just worried ;) [SEP] Sandra: I know ... [SEP] Olivia: Me?! [SEP] Sandra: I booked a slot on Friday afternoon after work.

My head is my worst enemy [SEP] Fran: You just met, don't force it. Why would you want chemistry that just dies out after 3 months?

It's more difficult to fall madly in love when you are not so easily fooled anymore ;) [SEP] Sally: I get it. It's not even about falling in love. I just don't get what happened. I mean I can't be in a relationship with absolutely no chemistry at all [SEP] Fran: Well it went away so maybe it will come back :D You can't overthink those things. They don't like it ;) [SEP] Sally: I probably am overthinking. We had a heart to heart and I feel much better after the talk [SEP] Fran: You want soulmates, intellectual connection, and chemistry - that's some high expectations for a new relation. Not everything at once [SEP] Sally: Yeah I would but I know I can't have it all [SEP] Fran: Of course you can. But some things work better overtime. On the other hand, do NOT force yourself into anything. [SEP] Sally: I'm not going to. I guess I've been lucky I found someone who is understanding and wants to discuss things [SEP] Fran: Exactly. And once you feel safer, chemistry might come back, because you won't be analyzing and thinking and worrying and pressuring yourself ;) [SEP] Sally: You're probably right."

[SEP] Patricia: [SEP] Barry: Holy shit, that's pretty impressive... I was pumped for the game already but now THIS is hype. Whoa. [SEP] Patricia: I know, right! I loved Wild Hunt but this is like a completely different level? [SEP] Barry: It really is. I guess we'll see when the game gets released but for once the NPCs seemed like real people, even the crowds. They said they'd be working on that and now I'm sold. [SEP] Patricia: Yeah, they didn't move awkwardly or anything, it really felt like the world was alive. I can't wait!! [SEP] Barry: It's only a shame about the POV... [SEP] Patricia: You don't like first-person? [SEP] Barry: Well, I guess it's okay at times but I'd prefer over-the-shoulder. They say you can customise everything about your character so I'd kind of like to be able to see my gear because otherwise what's the point. [SEP] Patricia: Huh... I actually haven't played first-person much, but I ended up really enjoying it in Morrowind. It felt really immersive and when I switched to third-person view for a moment, it felt strange. [SEP] Barry: Well, I'll still be hoping for an option to switch to third-person... [SEP] Patricia: I wouldn't really count on that. They seem really committed to their vision and think this is the best choice so people can enjoy the world 100%. [SEP] Barry: I'm still not sure but y'know, not gonna hate until it's actually release. It looks really good so far so I'd be happy if they proved me wrong and made me enjoy the POV. [SEP] Patricia: I just wish they'd tell us the release date already! [SEP] Barry: Hmm, who knows... I think it was supposed to be ready this year, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed."

And I likely will have to inerview people yeah. What kind of things do you do in the lab? [SEP] Ella: Depends on your field of study - I'm doing Embriology, so I basically conduct experiments on mouse oocytes that should hopefully give some decent results.

"Michaela: So what do you guys think about the association idea? [SEP] Ron: I might be lacking the context here [SEP] Michaela: Basically we were thinking of turning the club into an official association, so it's easier to get funds for events for example [SEP] Jessie: I'm torn actually - I get why it would help with funds, cooperation with other institutions and such, but I researched it and it involves quite a bit of paperwork. [SEP] Steve: And someone to take care of it permanently, cause it doesn't end at setting up the association - you have to do it every year. [SEP] Michaela: These are exactly the kind of things that I wanted to discuss with you. Do we have anyone willing to take care of the paperwork? Doesn't have to be one person. [SEP] Steve: Frankly, I don't see anyone doing this - we all have jobs, barely have time for meetings sometimes and it's a ton of responsibility [SEP] Ron: The question is - do the profits of being an association surpass the costs - like the amount of time and work we put into it? There are also some financial costs, are there? [SEP] Michaela: yeah, like a small fee when you set it up, but nothing more really. [SEP] Jessie: so what do we get from it really? [SEP] Michaela: maybe the cost of a rubber stamp. [SEP] Michaela: for example here are subsidies the city gives out every year, but to apply you need to be a formal association [SEP] Ron: and there was this time when that community center refused to work with us, because we weren't an association [SEP] Jessie: I think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually [SEP] Michaela: I recall two as well [SEP] Steve: but do we truly need those subsidies? We've worked for almost 4 years without them and for me that was the beauty of it - that you can organize events without spending tons of money on it, just with collective effort. [SEP] Steve: I'm just afraid we're gonna lose this sense of an informal get-together, it's all just gonna turn into a business and will create tensions between us. I've seen it happen to clubs like ours [SEP] Ron: it's not necessarily going to happen to us and we could make some better events with more funding [SEP] Michaela: association is not a business, we're not gonna start selling things. It's just about access to the possibilities that's we're denied right now cause we're not a formal association [SEP] Jessie: well... I could help out with the paperwork, but not alone. I'd say 2 more people would be enough to make this work [SEP] Michaela: as this was my idea, I can help too, just a matter of dividing our work properly [SEP] Ron: I can't take up additional responsibilities right now with all that's been going on, so I won't be able to help, buy if y'all agree it's a good idea, I'm going to support it [SEP] Michaela: Steve? [SEP] Steve: I don't know man, I like things the way they are right now [SEP] Michaela: Ok, maybe it's better to talk about this in person. Is Monday after the meeting ok for you all? [SEP] Steve: yup, I can stay a bit longer [SEP] Jessie: Fine by me [SEP] Ron: as well"

It's fine, I know you've been going through a rough patch [SEP] Bruce: I wrote coz I really wanted to know how you've been, you don't have to force yourself to act happy [SEP] Debra: Thanks, Bruce [SEP] Debra: I'm not sure I can express how much I appreciate the fact that you're here for me [SEP] Bruce: Don't mention it [SEP] Debra: No, it's a big thing to me... Actually, not too many people have talked to me recently, so I was a little lonely [SEP] Debra: I think I might cry, I'm sorry [SEP] Bruce: Oh no, please don't cry :( I'm here [SEP] Debra: I know... it's not entirely bad tears, it's also because I'm happy I have you [SEP] Debra: I'm just kind of emotional [SEP] Bruce: /hug [SEP] Debra: Thank you, really [SEP] Bruce: You know you can call me any time, don't you [SEP] Debra: Yeah...

Instead, you greeted her enumerating all the faults of the apartment (which I would also do, but I understand if it was too much for her). [SEP] Jan: Well then, I\'ll write to her and apologise, perhaps she\'ll change the review? [SEP] Emma: I doubt it, but you can try if you have a moment to spare. Again, I don\'t really think you\'ve done anything wrong, but upon some consideration, she might have misunderstood our non-Spanish behaviour [SEP] Jan: Yeah, I think you\'re right. Also, I assume this thing about cigarette fags all over the balcony is yet another delusion of hers? [SEP] Emma: Fuuuck. I actually might have left some...

In any case it\'s only one negative review by a silly old woman, I don\'t really think it\'ll ruin our lives [SEP] Jan: I feel like it\'ll totally ruin mine 💩 [SEP] Emma: Change your name to Juan as I\'ve been suggesting for years [SEP] Jan: 😂 [SEP] Ricardo: When life gives you lemons, change your name to Juan [SEP] Emma: And your life will be much fun lalalalaaaa 🎵 [SEP] Jan: AAAAAAAAAAAA 🙉🙉🙉'

'Leu: How are you? Any new development about the house? [SEP] Luisa: Hello my dear! Sadly not. No news at all regarding the house :(( We\'ll be sitting on it till the end of our lives! [SEP] Leu: That can\'t be. It is such a fantastic property. In such an incredibly beautiful estate. It\'s a matter of time. [SEP] Luisa: That\'s what we thought last spring when we put it on the market. [SEP] Leu: It took me 2 years to sell my flat back in Poland. [SEP] Luisa: Oh well... Wait and see. The last prospective buyers we had, 5 weeks back, were so enthusiastic we\'d thought we\'re done. They said ours was shortlisted, their favourite in Ballito, but they still wanted to check another estate. And that was it. She didn\'t even bother to phone, just sent me a minimal message. Bill got so frustrated that he drank himself stiff that night. [SEP] Leu: He does it from time to time, doesn\'t he? [SEP] Luisa: From time to time? Regularly!!! Can\'t you remember?! [SEP] Leu: Not quite. Never saw him really tight. [SEP] Luisa: Cause you used to leave before his evening was over. I\'m seriously worried about his health, to tell you the truth. It\'s just every day that he tipples. [SEP] Leu: As if slowly killing himself with liquor. [SEP] Luisa: He doesn\'t care. He says he\'s got his life behind him. [SEP] Leu: But it is terrible. How can you cope with it? [SEP] Luisa: I stopped to care too. It is his life. If he wants to put a quicker end to it, it\'s up to him. Look I cannot do anything about it. What hide bottles? Just don\'t want to have an invalid in my house one day. [SEP] Leu: Therapy? [SEP] Luisa: Gimme a break! Can you imagine Bill attending an AA therapy like a good boy! I can\'t. [SEP] Leu: Nor can I. [SEP] Luisa: We even stopped talking about his drinking problem long ago. When he started, just after and because of his early retirement, I thought I\'d better refrain from commenting because he\'s so depressed. But then it was worse and worse... Now it\'s too late. [SEP] Leu: Poor Luisa, poor Bill. It is so sad. But you are tough Luisa. You are so incredibly tough and strong and even-tempered, I\'d say. [SEP] Luisa: Yes, I am. That keeps me sane. I don\'t worry if I can\'t change it. To a degree... [SEP] Leu: Right you are! "The beach scape changes every month as tides bring in tons of sand and cover the rocks making the beach appear totally different." Do you remember? [SEP] Luisa: "Then the rocks are laid bare as the tide pulls away the sand. Such is life."'

'Max: Din anyone actually watch this the video?

But cannabis causes more inflammation of the lungs and increase symptoms such as wheeziness and shortness of breath. But these subside when cannabis smoking ceases.
